## Pinout
There are 11 data pins that need to be configured:
* 8 Data pins (D0 - D7)
* Enable pin (E)
* Register select (RS)
* Read/write select (RW)
## Timing

## Sending Commands
Looking at the timing diagrams, the commands are sent on the falling edge of the `enable` pin.

Therefore, to send commands, set the data bits and selects, then toggle the `enable` pin low and high. You can add a small delay between setting the enable pin low and high (1ms would do plenty).
