## Android Application
---
HoneyDo is a task management android app designed for quick and intuitive user experience and privacy.

HoneyDo features:

* Cloud storage using MongoDB as a database
* Login profiles in order to easily migrate to different devices while maintainig priavcy
* Ability to add, edit, and set notifications for tasks

I worked on HoneyDo with 4 other students in my Software Engineering course over a semester. Since we split up the work I primarily designed and created the front end while also working on the API functionality to tie the front-end to the back-end.
