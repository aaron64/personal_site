I created this driver to better understand ARM development with C. This driver connects to a HD44780 LCD controller to perform writes, reads, and inserting custom characters beyond ASCII. There are additional functions such as:

* Printf style formatting
* Printing in reverse
* Clearing screen
* Changing cursor type
